3. **Widget Timeline**: Currently shows static data, needs real updates
4. **Audio Session Management**: Needs background audio and Control Center integration
5. ✅ **~~Error Handling~~**: Fixed - Comprehensive error handling added
6. **Memory Management**: Need to optimize for large article datasets
7. **Network Resilience**: Need offline mode and graceful degradation
8. **API Rate Limits**: Monitor NewsAPI usage (1,000 requests/day free tier)

## 📊 Technical Architecture Status

### Core Data Layer ✅ COMPLETE
- **SimplePersistenceController**: Manages Core Data stack with programmatic model creation
- **SimpleDataService**: Handles all CRUD operations with intelligent MockData fallback  
- **Auto-generated Entities**: Xcode creates entity classes from DataModel.xcdatamodeld
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully falls back to MockData if Core Data fails

### Data Flow Architecture ✅ WORKING
```
Views (TodayView, IndustryOverview) 
    ↓
SimpleDataService (Data Layer)
    ↓ 
SimplePersistenceController (Core Data)
    ↓ (fallback)
MockData (Backup Data)
```

### Current File Structure
```
moning/
├── CoreData/
│   ├── SimplePersistenceController.swift ✅
│   ├── SimpleDataService.swift ✅
│   └── DataModel.xcdatamodeld/ ✅
├── Views/ (Updated to use real data)
│   ├── IndustryOverviewView.swift ✅
│   ├── LatestArticlesView.swift ✅
