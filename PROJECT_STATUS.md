## 🔥 Next Priority Tasks

### 1. Navigation & Deep Linking (HIGH)
```swift
// Missing features:
- URL scheme handling from widget taps
- Article Detail View (full reading experience)
- Search functionality with Core Data
- External link sharing
```

### 2. Push Notifications (MEDIUM)
```swift  
// User engagement features:
- Breaking news alerts (priority articles)
- Daily digest notifications
- Notification categories and actions
- Do Not Disturb integration
```

### 3. Advanced UI Polish (LOW)
```swift  
// Nice-to-have:
- Advanced animations and transitions
- Accessibility improvements
- Dark mode optimizations
```

## 📊 Technical Metrics

### Performance
- **App Launch**: < 2 seconds
- **Widget Update**: Every 2 hours
- **Data Sources**: 250-300 articles/day
- **Storage**: ~60-260MB total

### Architecture Benefits
- **Zero-friction UX**: No signup required
- **Privacy-first**: All data stays local  
- **Offline-capable**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Scalable**: Can add iCloud sync later

## 🚨 Known Issues & Tech Debt

1. **Widget concurrency warnings** (Swift 6 mode) - cosmetic only
2. **No article detail view** - currently opens source URLs
3. **Search not implemented** - planned for future release
4. **URL scheme handling incomplete** - widget deep links need implementation
