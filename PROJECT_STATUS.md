```

- Search functionality with Core Data
- External link sharing
```

### 3. Advanced UI Polish (LOW)
```swift  
// Nice-to-have:

2. **Audio system incomplete** - no background playback yet
3. **No article detail view** - currently opens source URLs
4. **Search not implemented** - planned for future release
