‚òï **Good morning, tech world!** 
Welcome to your weekly dose of Silicon Valley chaos, served with a side of existential dread about AI taking over the world.

ü§ñ **This week in "AI is everywhere":**
OpenAI's latest models are apparently so good they're making GPT-4 look like a calculator. Meanwhile, every startup in existence has pivoted to add "AI-powered" to their pitch deck. Revolutionary? Maybe. Inevitable? Absolutely.

üîí **In "Why we can't have nice things" news:**
Security researchers continue to find ways to hack literally everything with an internet connection. This week: cars. Because apparently having vulnerable smart toasters wasn't enough.

üí∞ **Money talks (and VCs listen):**
AI startups are raising rounds faster than you can say "artificial general intelligence." Current valuation requirements: have "AI" in your company name and a founder who's been on a podcast.

üîÆ **Crystal ball time:**
Next week will probably feature more AI breakthroughs, more security vulnerabilities, and more hot takes about whether we're living in the future or a dystopian novel. 

Spoiler alert: it's both.
